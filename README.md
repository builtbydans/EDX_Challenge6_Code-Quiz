# EDX FE Bootcamp Challenge Six: Code Quiz

## The Task

The task for the sixth module was to create a JavaScript program that allowed users to participate in a quiz. The quiz had four questions and whenever the user would get a correct answer, 25 points would be added to their score counter. Whenever the user would get the answer wrong, 10 seconds would be deducted from the timer.

By the end of the quiz, the user is able to view their highscore which has been saved in localStorage().
